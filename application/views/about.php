			<h1>ButtonOS Roots</h1>
			<p>The ButtonOS Project was thought up by the people at Curly Cloud, a small (but ambitious) group of designers and developers. Curly Cloud helps clients and companies, large and small build up a web presence by leveraging "cloud" technology.</p>

			<h1>The Problem</h1>
			<p>Quite a few clients Curly Cloud talked with mentioned how they found it difficult and frustrating to use the Internet on a "conventional" computer. Prompted with required updates, virus scans, and error messages full of gobbledygook, these users didn't know what was wrong or how to fix it.</p>

			<h1>The Answer</h1>
			<p>Computer users shouldn't have to be computer administrators. Putting a regular user in control of an entire computer makes about as much sense to ask a creative painter to build a 40-story skyscraper. Users just want to <strong>use</strong> the computer, and not be bothered with figuring out how it operates.</p>

			<h1>The Solution...ButtonOS</h1>
			<p>The Curly Cloud team knew something could be done to help computer users enjoy using the computer again. A little over six months later, ButtonOS was born, exceeding even our original expectations.</p>

			<h1>Why Name it ButtonOS?</h1>
			<p>The name "ButtonOS", short for "Common Denominator," was thought up by Curly Cloud team member Ryan Lelek in hopes of reflecting the top priority of the ButtonOS Project - to provide a common base for computers both new and old. The name ButtonOS just kind of stuck after that!</p>

			<h1>He Likes It! (Hey Mikey!)</h1>
			<p>After letting some people give ButtonOS a try, it's clear they like what's going on. They can easily browse the Internet on their current computer with ButtonOS, without worrying about catching a virus, annoying pop-ups, or system slow-downs. Sure, ButtonOS doesn't do <em>everything</em>, but what it does, it does well.</p>

			<h1>To Infinity and Beyond!</h1>
			<p>Curly Cloud is so happy with the first version of ButtonOS and the reactions of its (testing) users, we've decided to start development on a second version. There's been some interesting talk about features in the next version and we can't wait to get them up and running!</p>

			<h1>Can I Help?</h1>
			<p>You sure can! It all starts on Curly Cloud's "Get Satisfaction" page. Ask us a question, add a comment, or just let us know how you use ButtonOS.<br /><a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/curlycloud/topics/new">Let's Go to the Curly Cloud Page</a></p>
